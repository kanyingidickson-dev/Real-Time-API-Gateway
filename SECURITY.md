# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please avoid filing public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report privately to the repository maintainer (for example via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting / Security Advisories, if enabled) with:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Any suggested remediation

## Supported versions

Only the latest `main` branch is supported at this time.
